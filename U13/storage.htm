<p>Phone memory refers to RAM (Random Access Memory). RAM is the part of the phone 
that is used to store the operating system (OS) and where apps and data 
currently in use are kept. Whereas, phone storage is used to store data such as 
apps, photos, videos, and files that are necessary for the phone to run. RAM is 
a lot faster than phone storage but you don’t have as much of it.</p>
<p>Overall, for most casual smartphone users 64GB phone memory is enough, although 
many people prefer to choose between 128GB and 256GB. Those who use their mobile 
phone to the absolute maximum should consider phones with storage of 512GB and 
1TB to avoid running out of storage space and suffering with a slow phone speed.</p>
<p><u>Why is storage so important for mobile phones?</u></p>
<p>We need them to store photos, videos, apps, contacts, stream music and 
films, download emails, messages and webpages, and much more. It's no 
wonder all of these tasks take up so much storage.</p>
<p>If you play a lot of mobile games and/or take a lot of high-res photos, you'll 
want at least 128GB. However, if you don't use many apps and stream most of your 
content (like movies and music), you'll probably be fine with 64GB.</p>
<p>The way that you can find your Android phone's storage capacity will depend on 
the manufacturer and there is also a variance between models. Typically, storage 
capacity information is stored in Settings - Storage 
however if you have a Samsung phone, you can find the total storage capacity 
information under Settings - Device - Care</p>
<p>While 32GB or 64GB might sound like a lot, it 
may be insufficient if you tend to store a fair amount of games, music or photos 
and videos on your phone. 
That's because your phone's operating system (OS) and default apps take up a 
decent chunk of internal memory.</p>
<p>64GB: limited storage space. 128GB: enough for basic use. 256GB: enough for the 
average user. 512GB: store your entire photo, video, and movie collection.</p>
<p>512GB is exclusively for those who either shoot a lot of 4K RAW videos, download 
dozens of movies and TV shows, or similar. Unless you're one of those people, 
you definitely don't need that much storage. That said, 512GB can be good to 
future-proof your phone.</p>
