<p>Mobile phones, particularly the smartphones that have become our inseparable 
companions today, are relatively new.</p>
<p>However, the history of mobile phones goes back to 1908 when a US Patent was 
issued in Kentucky for a wireless telephone.</p>
<p>Mobile phones were invented as early as the 1940s when engineers working at ATT 
developed cells for mobile phone base stations.</p>
<p>The very first mobile phones were not really mobile phones at all. They were two-way 
radios that allowed people like taxi drivers and the emergency services to 
communicate.</p>
<p>Instead of relying on base stations with separate cells (and the signal being 
passed from one cell to another), the first mobile phone networks involved one 
very powerful base station covering a much wider area.</p>
<p>Motorola, on 3 April 1973 were first company to mass produce the the first 
handheld mobile phone.</p>
<p>These early mobile phones are often referred to as 0G mobile 
phones, or Zero Generation mobile phones. Most phones today rely on 4G mobile technology.</p>
