<p>Designed initially to access mobile phone networks, a SIM 
card authenticates the subscriber and ensures 
the user is accurately billed for used airtime.</p>
<p>The SIM also stores your phone directories, messages, information on roaming 
across different networks, and many other value-added voice and data services.</p>
<p>End-users can instantly access news, games, chat, dating services, and mobile 
payment applications with an easy-to-use interface.</p>
<p>The handset model does not restrict it. This feature enables operators to reach 
all of their customers.</p>
<p>Operator-centered services such as call completion and<span></span>automatic 
handset configuration help reduce customer billing costs and increase their 
Average Revenue per User (ARPU).</p>
<p>The SIM is the final link between networks and end-users, and no customer can 
connect to the network without their SIM card.</p>
<p>Network operators can communicate, download applications, and manage a SIM card 
remotely usingOver-the-Air (OTA) technology.</p>
<p> For example, with OTA, network operators can update SIM 
cards with new applications and services 
without requiring users to upgrade their handsets or visit a store.</p>
