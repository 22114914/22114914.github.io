<p><u>What is a cache?</u></p>
<p>A cache -- pronounced CASH -- is hardware or software that is used to store 
something, usually data, temporarily in a computing environment.</p>
<p>It is a small amount of faster, more expensive memory used to improve the 
performance of recently or frequently accessed data. Cached data is stored 
temporarily in an accessible storage media that's local to the cache client and 
separate from the main storage. Cache is commonly used by the central processing 
unit (CPU), applications, web browsers and operating systems.</p>
<p>Cache is used because bulk or main storage can't keep up with the demands of 
clients. Cache decreases data access times, reduces latency and improves 
input/output (I/O). Because almost all application workloads depend on I/O 
operations, the caching process improves application performance.</p>
<p><u>How does a cache work?</u></p>
<p>When a cache client attempts to access data, it first checks the cache. If the 
data is found there, that is referred to as a cache hit. 
The percent of attempts that result in a cache hit is called the cache 
hit rate, or ratio.</p>
<p>Requested data that isn't found in the cache -- referred to as a cache miss -- 
is pulled from main memory and copied into the cache. How this is done, and what 
data is ejected from the cache to make room for the new data, depends on the caching 
algorithm, cache protocols and system policies being used.</p>
<p>Web browsers like Safari, Firefox and Chrome use browser caching to improve the 
performance of frequently accessed webpages. When a user visits a webpage, the 
requested files are stored in a cache for that browser in the user's computing 
storage.</p>
<p>To retrieve a previously accessed page, the browser gets most of the files it 
needs from the cache rather than having them resent from the web 
server. This approach is called read cache. The browser can read 
data from the browser cache faster than it can reread the files from the 
webpage.</p>
